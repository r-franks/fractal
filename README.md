# fractal
Fractal is a package that implements a range of different fractals and facilitates interesting transformations of them.

## Basic Fractals
At the moment, the package can generate the following types of fractals which correspond to the three fractal related submodules (<code>fractal.geometry_fractal</code>, <code>fractal.com_fractal</code>, and <code>fractal.appollonian</code>:

* Sierpinski Triangle, Pentagonal Fractal and the rest family of fractals generated by the iterated adding and rescaling of a regular polygon (use <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/fractal/geometry_fractal.py#L95">reg_poly_fractal</a> from <code>geomtry_fractal</code>)
* Center of Mass Fractal (Triangle)  (use <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/fractal/com_fractal.py#L88">com_fractal</a> from <code>com_fractal</code>)
* Appollonian Gasket (use <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/fractal/appollonian.py#L65">chaos_map_iter</a> from <code>appollonian</code>)

The descriptions of the parameters for each of these functions can be found by following the links. When plotted, the basic fractals look like this:

For more examples of usage, see the <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/demo_plots.ipynb">plot demo</a> (base fractals correspond to the left images).
 
## Maps and Transformations
At the moment, the only implemented map/transformations are derived from a process that "folds" a triangular object into a circular one by breaking it into horizontal strips and bending those strips into concentric circles (like the reverse of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whYqhpc6S6g">visual proof</a>. This is done by the <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/fractal/triangle_folding.py#L139">unfold_iso_triangle</a> function in <code>triangle_folding</code>. This function also a level of post-processing flexibility: If one specifies the <code>custom_map</code> parameter as a function that takes polar coordinates (r, θ) to new coordinates (r', θ'), then this transformation will be applied to the circle resulting to the folding process before it is returned. For more details, the descriptions of the parameters of this function can be found by following its link.

Below is an example of what <code>unfold_iso_triangle</code> can do (from left to right: the original Sierpinski Triangle, the impact the transformation has on it, and the impact the transformation with a <code>custom_map</code> has on it).

 ## Animation/Gifs
One way to explore the impacts of different <code>custom_map</code>s is through animating a fractal as the <code>custom_map</code> applied to it gradually changes. This can be done with the <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/fractal/animation.py#L5">animate</a> function in <code>animation</code> which works for general purpose simple animated plots. This function has some flexible behavior:
* Provide a list of 2d numpy arrays to the <code>vals_list</code> parameter and <code>animate</code> will produce a gif of each numpy array plotted in sequence
* Provide a list of <em>lists</em> of 2d numpy arrays to <code>vals_list</code> and <code>animate</code> will plot every 2d numpy array sharing a list in the same frame, for each list in the list of lists

For details on parameters, see the link earlier in this section. For examples of usage, see the <a href="https://github.com/r-franks/fractal/blob/main/demo_animation.ipynb">animation demo</a> which shows how many different fractals may be animated using the <code>animate</code> function. An example gif produced using this <code>animate</code> function is below:
